# FACE-EMOTION-RECOGNITION-
**Objective**: The objective of this project is to develop a system that can automatically detect and recognize human emotions from facial expressions in images or videos.

**Description**: The project involves several key steps:

**Data Collection**: Collect a dataset of facial images with labelled emotions (e.g., happy, sad, angry, etc.). This dataset will be used to train and test the machine learning model.

**Preprocessing**: Preprocess the images to standardize them for analysis. This may include resizing, normalization, and grayscale conversion.

**Feature Extraction**: Extract features from the images that are relevant for emotion recognition. Common features include facial landmarks, texture patterns, and HOG features.

**Model Training**: Train a machine learning model (e.g., SVM, Random Forest, CNN) using the extracted features and the labelled dataset. The model learns to recognize patterns associated with different emotions.

**Model Evaluation**: Evaluate the trained model using a separate test dataset to assess its performance in recognizing emotions accurately.

**Deployment**: Deploy the trained model in a real-time application where it can analyze facial expressions in images or videos and predict the corresponding emotions.

**Technologies Used**: Python, OpenCV, scikit-learn, matplotlib (for visualization).
